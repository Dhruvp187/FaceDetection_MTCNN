# Face Detection with MTCNN

Welcome to the Face Detection repository utilizing the MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model! This project employs MTCNN for detecting faces in both images and videos.

## Repository Structure:

- **InputFolderForImageAndVideoFiles:** This folder contains the input images and videos on which you want to perform face detection.

- **OutputFolder:** The output of the code will be saved in this folder. It includes annotated images/videos with detected faces.

- **FaceRecognition_MTCNN.py:** The main Python script that implements face detection using the MTCNN model.

## Dependencies:

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the code.

```bash
pip install opencv-python mtcnn matplotlib
```

## Instructions to Run:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-mtcnn.git
cd face-detection-mtcnn
```

2. **Run the Code:**

```bash
python FaceRecognition_MTCNN.py
```

The script will process the images and videos in the input folder and save the results in the output folder.

## Code Functionality:

The provided Python script, `FaceRecognition_MTCNN.py`, is designed to perform face detection using the MTCNN model. Here's an overview of how the code operates:

### Image Processing:

1. **Image Loading:**
   - The script reads images from the specified `InputFolderForImageAndVideoFiles` directory.

2. **Preprocessing (Optional):**
   - Implement preprocessing steps to enhance image quality or improve face detection accuracy. This may include operations such as resizing, normalization, or noise reduction.

3. **Face Detection:**
   - Utilizing the MTCNN model, faces are detected in each image.

4. **Annotating Detected Faces:**
   - Detected faces are outlined with rectangles, and the processed images are saved in the `OutputFolder` directory.

5. **User Input:**
   - The user is prompted to enter the actual number of faces in the image for later comparison.

6. **Comparison and Logging:**
   - The script compares the detected faces with the user-provided actual count.
   - The results, including the detected faces, actual faces, and differences, are logged.

### Video Processing:

1. **Video Loading:**
   - Similarly, the script reads videos from the specified `InputFolderForImageAndVideoFiles` directory.

2. **Preprocessing (Optional):**
   - Implement preprocessing steps to enhance video frames or improve face detection accuracy. This may include operations such as resizing, normalization, or noise reduction.

3. **Face Detection in Frames:**
   - Frames from the video are processed individually for face detection.

4. **Annotating Detected Faces in Frames:**
   - Detected faces in each frame are outlined, and the processed frames are saved in a new video file.

5. **User Input for Video:**
   - The user is prompted to enter the total actual number of faces in the video.

6. **Comparison and Logging for Video:**
   - The script compares the detected faces in each frame with the user-provided total count.
   - The results, including the detected faces, actual faces, and differences over frames, are logged.

### Plotting Results:

1. **Image Results Plotting:**
   - If image processing occurs, a plot is generated showing the number of detected faces and the actual number of faces for each processed image.

2. **Video Results Plotting:**
   - If video processing occurs, a plot is generated showing the number of detected faces in each frame and the total actual number of faces in the video.

## Scope for Use:

This repository can be used for various applications, including:

1. **Security Systems:** Implement face detection for surveillance systems.
   
2. **Data Annotation:** Automatically annotate faces in images and videos.

3. **Video Analysis:** Analyze and count faces in videos for various purposes.

4. **User Interaction:** Use face detection for applications involving user interaction.

## Additional Expansion:

1. **Frame Skipping:**
   - Adjust the `frame_skip` parameter in the `process_video` function to control the number of frames processed. This can be useful for faster video processing on large datasets.

2. **Integration with Other Models:**
   - Explore the possibility of integrating other face detection models to compare performance and accuracy.

3. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - Modify the code to perform face detection in real-time using a webcam.

4. **Integration with Deep Learning Models:**
   - Investigate opportunities to integrate deep learning models for enhanced face detection accuracy.

## Adding Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Preprocessing for Images:**
   - Implement additional preprocessing steps in the `process_image` function to enhance image quality or improve face detection accuracy. Experiment with operations such as resizing, normalization, or noise reduction.

2. **Preprocessing for Videos:**
   - Extend the `process_video` function to include preprocessing steps for individual frames. This may involve resizing, normalization, or other operations to improve face detection accuracy in videos.

## Documentation Improvement:

Enhance the documentation to provide clear instructions on integrating preprocessing steps for images and videos. Explain the potential benefits of preprocessing for face detection accuracy and usability.
